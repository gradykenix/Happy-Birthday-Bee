# Happy-Birthday-Bee

This is a Python file that I made to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday :)

Since I like to send you pictures of flower arrangements, and you like ASCII art, I figured combining the two of them couldn't be the worst idea! This file, when run in a full-size terminal window (preferably with Truecolor capability), will create a rotating bouquet. You can choose from a number of different types of color schemes, or input your own palette. 

Before the bouquet is made, it's arranged -- by (very roughly) simulating nucleon interactions through the residual strong force, as given by the Reid potential. 

There's also a really, really buggy version that I never did manage to fix, but it's included anyway -- this is the realistic version, which uses more than just blobs of color to display the bouquet. The edges work in terms of the viewer angle -- a rotating \ will turn into a |, then a /, then a | and back again, etc. -- but the actual putting-together of the flowers themselves is absolutely vile!! Still, it occasionally looks neat, so I included it. I'll probably try to fix that at some point in the summer holidays :) but the main deal is the blob-mode rotating bouquet, which is (hopefully) bug-free!

Happy 19th birthday <3
